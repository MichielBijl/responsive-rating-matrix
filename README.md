# Responsive Rating Matrix
A [responsive—and hopefully accessible—rating matrix](http://michielbijl.github.io/responsive-rating-matrix/). It's not really a matrix though; it is in fact a list made to look like a matrix on large displays. There is also a [table based example](http://michielbijl.github.io/responsive-rating-matrix/table.html).

The final version of this should pass [WCAG 1.3.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation).
